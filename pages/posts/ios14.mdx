## iOS 14

Over the past few years, I've paid attention to my homescreen less and less. My most commonly used apps were placed in the Homebar, and any other app that I needed on demand were opened via the [swipe to search search](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201285).
In iOS 14, iPhone homescreens got a major upgrade with the addition of
[widgets](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-14/#ios_14_overview). Since I wasn't
using my home screen to open apps, I saw this as an opportunity to revamp my homescreen
and dig into [iOS shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios).

<div
  className="flex-container"
  style={{ display: "flex", "flexWrap": "wrap", margin: "auto" }}
>
  <div style={{ margin: "auto" }}>
    <img
      src="/images/iOS14/homescreen_1.jpeg"
      width={375 / 2}
      height={812 / 2}
      alt="iPhone Homescreen"
    />
  </div>
  <div style={{ margin: "auto" }}>
    <img
      src="/images/iOS14/homescreen_2.jpeg"
      width={375 / 2}
      height={812 / 2}
      alt="iPhone Homescreen"
    />
  </div>
</div>

## Home page
I've removed most the apps on my main homescreen in place for widgets that are somewhat useful, but mainly provide a descent aesthetic.
The github contribution chart is my favorite since it's both pleasing and motivating to look at. The apps that do show up on my
home page are selected by the smart stack widget in iOS 14. I'm predictable enough that the suggested aps are on the mark more often
then not, and supplement my most frequented apps in the Homebar. 

## Shortcuts
The second page on my iPhone is dedicated to Shortcuts. I have bin that allows me to run a few of my favorite shortcuts. Some, I've created
myself and others I have taken from the beautiful site [ShortcutsGallery.com](https://shortcutsgallery.com/). Here are some of my favorites: 

* [Split it](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/63133e55f80d4141a0be03ee42c417ff) - Prompts you for an amount and the number of people you will be splitting the bill with. It then
lets you select them from your contacts and sends them a cash app request. 
* [Define Word](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/c812de0b16514f49ab4e73362aed2bf0) - Defines a word and logs the word to Dropbox. The aim here is to keep track of the words 
you encounter in the wild, potentially exporting them to your favorite SRS.
* [Water eject](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/5864cdea5cd942198873dbd51d1a344e) - If you are like me and consider yourself a bathroom freestyle rapper, you'll love this one.
Just like the water eject feature on apple watch, this shortcuts plays a sound which frequency will clear your speakers of any water clogging your speakers. 
* [Network tool](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/99e14f8398d6434394c470185c591e7d) - Two clicks away to a speed test or a QR code to share your wifi. A nice little tool you didn't know you 
needed until it you use it once.
